# List 

# List is a Data Structure (a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. )
# Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable, eg :  list1= ["fox","hunter","lord"]  

# Conditional Statements

# elif statement 

#The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
# At the above example if it is none of the decisions it will try the condition 'else'
